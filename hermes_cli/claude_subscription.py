"""Release gate for the "Claude subscription via Agent SDK" runtime.

The runtime ships default-off because Anthropic's Agent SDK overview states
that third party developers may not offer claude.ai login or rate limits for
their products without prior approval, while their Help Center simultaneously
says SDK usage still draws from subscription limits — an unresolved tension.
Until Anthropic confirms in writing, only a developer running private
validation on their own consenting account may flip this on; see
`docs/design/claude-subscription-via-agent-sdk.md` for the full record.

This module is imported by the provider catalog and the dashboard web server,
so it must stay dependency-light and must never raise at import time.
